// 1. You are given a string str.
// 2. Complete the body of getSS function - without changing signature - to calculate all subsequences of str.
// Use sample input and output to take idea about subsequences.

// Note -> The online judge can't force you to write the function recursively but that is what the spirit of question is.
// Write recursive and not iterative logic. The purpose of the question is to aid learning recursion and not test you.
